# hello-world
a github learning exercise

A mom and liberal arts major, always fascinated with tech and now finally learning all those things I could've learned in college but didn't...why? Because learning is fun, and developing new skills is necessary for survival. And maybe because I hope I can teach my daughter a few things, but more likely than not she will be teaching me in years to come.
